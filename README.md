# Statistics : Linear Models Practicals

This repository contains practical work assignments completed for the SD-TSIA204 "Statistics: Linear Models" course at Télécom Paris during the second year of study.

## Course Overview

The course covers linear regression from both statistical and Machine Learning perspectives, including:

1. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression
2. Statistical tests and confidence intervals for regression coefficients
3. Dimension reduction techniques (PCA and forward variable selection)
4. Penalized regression methods (Ridge and LASSO)

## Practical Works

### Practical Work 1: Linear Regression Fundamentals

This practical focuses on:
- Implementing one-dimensional and multi-dimensional linear regression models
- Estimating regression coefficients and their standard deviations
- Conducting significance tests on regression coefficients
- Calculating confidence and prediction intervals
- Visualizing regression results in 2D and 3D

### Practical Work 2: Advanced Regression Techniques

This practical covers:
- Working with real-world datasets (California Housing)
- Implementing forward variable selection
- Applying Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regularization
- Principal Component Regression (PCR)
- Model comparison and evaluation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Note

These practicals were completed as part of the coursework for SD-TSIA204 at Télécom Paris. The code and analyses demonstrate the application of linear regression techniques and related statistical concepts.
